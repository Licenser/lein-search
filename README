# lein-search

Lein search allows searching and adding of dependencies on clojars through a simple command line interface.

## Usage

lein update-repo (update local clojar index - this is cached to save bandwith)
lein search <regexp> (searches clojars for this regexp)
lein add [-d|--dev] <artifact> (allows you to add a artifact to your development dependencies)
lein add <artifact> (allows you to add a artifact to your dependencies)
lein update (updates all artifacts in your deps, asking for each one if you'd like it)

artifact syntax:

lein-search - latest stable official release (as in [lein-search/lein-search "whatever is latest stable"])
lein-search "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT" - one specific version of the official release
org.clojars.wuschel/lein-search - a non official release, and it's latest stable
org.clojars.wuschel/lein-search  "42.2.3" - a non official release, and it's latest stable
